## Project Abstract

Snake is a game where the purpose is for the player to maneuver a line that grows in length.

        How does thhe game work? 
        
The snake will always start at the center of the board, moving up. The snake moves at a constant speed and can only move in four directions: Up, Down, Left, and Right. The arrow keys by the player control the movement of the snake. The snake grows by eating “apples.” These apples appear at random times, lasting a random amount of time. This time interval is typically long enough for the snake to get to the apple. There can only be one apple that appears at a time. When the snake runs into the apple or “eats” the apple, it gets longer. The game continues until the snake dies. The snake dies in two ways: running into the edge of the board and running into its tail. The score at the end of the game is base on how many apples have been eaten. The game continuously gets more challenging as the snake gets bigger.
